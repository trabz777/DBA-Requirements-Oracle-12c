# DBA-Requirements-Oracle-12c
The report will document the whole process of implementing vital DBA requirements using Oracle 12c. First 5 are pure DBA requirements while the rest of 3 are problem solving
requirements for which a planned strategy is proposed. Read the report for full understanding of each requirement and my proposed solutions. This report will specially be helpful
for those who are interested or begining their career in Database Administration. 

You can mimic this project if you have access or your organisation is using Oracle Database server (via SQL Plus or SQL Developer).
